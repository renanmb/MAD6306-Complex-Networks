\item Demonstrate the following for undirected networks:
\begin{enumerate}
\item A 3 regular graph must have an even number of nodes.\vspace{5cm}
\item The average degree of a tree is strictly less than 2.
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{5cm}

\item A star graph consists of a single central node with $n-1$ other nodes connected to it. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Find the adjacency matrix of the following start network with nodes N:
\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[width=0.4\linewidth]{stargraph.png}
\end{figure}
\item Find the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix. 
\end{enumerate}

\clearpage

\item {\bf Average degree of a growing network} Assume that you are observing a growing undirected network.
The network evolves in time by this simple rules:
\begin{itemize}
\item At time $t = 1$ there is a single isolated node.
\item At each time $t > 1$ a new node is added to the network and is connected
to the existing network by a new link.
\end{itemize}
Consider the network at time $t = T$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the total number of nodes N? \vspace{1cm}
\item What is the total number of links L?\vspace{1cm}
\item What is the average degree $\langle k \rangle$?\vspace{1cm}
\item  What is the average degree in the limit $T \rightarrow +\infty $?\vspace{1cm}
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{3cm}

\item One can calculate the diameter of certain types of network exactly. Assume that each of these network has network size N.
\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the diameter of a fully connected network?\vspace{1cm}
\item What is the diameter of a star network?\vspace{1cm}
\item What is the diameter of a linear chain of N nodes? \vspace{1cm}
\item What is the small world diameter property? \vspace{1cm}
\item Which of the above networks are small-world? In another word, which networks have SWDP?
\end{enumerate}
\clearpage

\item Please submit the network for your final project, including the following. This is a group work. Please discuss with your team members but each one needs to submit the individual report. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item What is your network?\vspace{1cm}
\item Where you get the data?\vspace{1cm}
\item Describe your network including the application area, size, nodes.\vspace{1cm}
\item Why you (or your team) want to study this network. 
\end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}
